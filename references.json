    "abstract": "Recent reports of a novel group of flaviviruses that replicate only in mosquitoes and appear to spread through insect populations via vertical transmission have emerged from around the globe. To date, there is no information on the presence or prevalence of these insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) in Australian mosquito species. To assess whether such viruses occur locally, we used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flavivirus universal primers that are specific to the NS5 gene to detect these viruses in mosquito pools collected from the Northern Territory. Of 94 pools of mosquitoes, 13 were RT-PCR positive, and of these, 6 flavivirus isolates were obtained by inoculation of mosquito cell culture. Sequence analysis of the NS5 gene revealed that these isolates are genetically and phylogenetically similar to ISFs reported from other parts of the world. The entire coding region of one isolate (designated 56) was sequenced and shown to have approximately 63.7% nucleotide identity and 66.6% amino acid identity with its closest known relative (Nakiwogo virus) indicating that the prototype Australian ISF represents a new species. All isolates were obtained from Coquillettidia xanthogaster mosquitoes. The new virus is tentatively named Palm Creek virus (PCV) after its place of isolation. We also demonstrated that prior infection of cultured mosquito cells with PCV suppressed subsequent replication of the medically significant West Nile and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses by 10-43 fold (1 to 1.63 log) at 48 hr post-infection, suggesting that superinfection exclusion can occur between ISFs and vertebrate-infecting flaviviruses despite their high level of genetic diversity. We also generated several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are specific to the NS1 protein of PCV, and these represent the first ISF-specific mAbs reported to date.",

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) is an important zoonotic flavivirus responsible for mild fever to severe, lethal neuroinvasive disease in humans, horses, birds, and other wildlife species. Since its discovery, WNV has caused multiple human and animal disease outbreaks in all continents, except Antarctica. Infections are associated with economic losses, mainly due to the cost of treatment of infected patients, control programmes, and loss of animals and animal products. The pathogenesis of WNV has been extensively investigated in natural hosts as well as in several animal models, including rodents, lagomorphs, birds, and reptiles. However, most of the proposed pathogenesis hypotheses remain contentious, and much remains to be elucidated. At the same time, the unavailability of specific antiviral treatment or effective and safe vaccines contribute to the perpetuation of the disease and regular occurrence of outbreaks in both endemic and non-endemic areas. Moreover, globalisation and climate change are also important drivers of the emergence and re-emergence of the virus and disease. Here, we give an update of the pathobiology, epidemiology, diagnostics, control, and “One Health” implications of WNV infection and disease.",

    "abstract": "To determine the cause of an unprecedented outbreak of encephalitis among horses in New South Wales, Australia, in 2011, we performed genomic sequencing of viruses isolated from affected horses and mosquitoes. Results showed that most of the cases were caused by a variant West Nile virus (WNV) strain, WNVNSW2011, that is most closely related to WNV Kunjin (WNVKUN), the indigenous WNV strain in Australia. Studies in mouse models for WNV pathogenesis showed that WNVNSW2011 is substantially more neuroinvasive than the prototype WNVKUN strain. In WNVNSW2011, this apparent increase in virulence over that of the prototype strain correlated with at least 2 known markers of WNV virulence that are not found in WNVKUN. Additional studies are needed to determine the relationship of the WNVNSW2011 strain to currently and previously circulating WNVKUN strains and to confirm the cause of the increased virulence of this emerging WNV strain.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Few insect-specific alphaviruses (ISA) have been discovered, with even fewer culturable to facilitate full characterisation. Here, we report the recovery of an infectious clone of Yada Yada virus (YYV)—a virus previously only detected by metagenomic sequencing of mosquito homogenates. Using the infectious clone, we confirmed the inability of YYV to replicate in vertebrate cells in vitro, with replication limited to only Aedes mosquito-derived cell lines. We further produced and characterised the first monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to ISAs. Through successful replacement of the structural proteins of YYV with those of other ISAs, Eilat virus, Agua Salud (ASALV), Taï Forest (TALV) and Mwinilunga alphaviruses (MWAV), we established that a replication block for in vitro culture of TALV and MWAV in mosquito cells does not exist at virus entry. Unexpectedly, ASALV structural proteins were recognised by cross-reactive mAbs made to chikungunya (CHIKV) and Ross River viruses (RRV), suggesting a potential antigenic link between ASALV and pathogenic alphaviruses. The YYV genetic backbone was also investigated to generate chimeras displaying the structural proteins of various pathogenic vertebrate-infecting alphaviruses including CHIKV, RRV, Barmah Forest, Sindbis and Mayaro viruses. These chimeras retained the antigenic properties of the parental viruses and did not replicate in vertebrate cells, demonstrating the potential of the YYV platform for vaccine and diagnostic antigen production.",
