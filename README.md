## Getting Started — Setting Up Your Computer

This guide is written for anyone with no prior coding experience. Follow each step in order.

### Step 1 — Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is the program you use to open and edit the website files.

1. Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Click the large **Download** button — it will automatically detect your operating system (Windows or Mac)
3. Open the downloaded file and follow the installer prompts
4. Once installed, open **Visual Studio Code** from your Applications folder (Mac) or Start Menu (Windows)

### Step 2 — Install Git

Git is the tool that sends your changes to the live website on GitHub.

**Mac:**
1. Open the **Terminal** app (search for it in Spotlight with Cmd + Space)
2. Type `git --version` and press Enter
3. If Git is not installed, a prompt will appear asking you to install it — click **Install** and follow the steps

**Windows:**
1. Go to [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Download and run the installer — accept all default settings

### Step 3 — Download the Website Files

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) to open the Command Palette
3. Type `Git: Clone` and press Enter
4. Paste this URL: `https://github.com/peterslab-uq/Lab-Website.git`
5. Choose a folder on your computer to save the files (e.g. your Desktop)
6. Click **Open** when VS Code asks if you want to open the cloned repository

You will now see all the website files listed in the left-hand panel.

### Step 4 — Install the Live Preview Extension (recommended)

This lets you see changes in real time without opening a browser manually.

1. In VS Code, click the **Extensions** icon in the left sidebar (it looks like four squares)
2. Search for `Live Preview`
3. Click **Install** on the extension by Microsoft
4. To use it: right-click `index.html` in the file panel and select **Show Preview**

3. Make your edit
4. Save the file with **Ctrl+S** (Windows) or **Cmd+S** (Mac)

### Publishing your changes to the live site

After saving your edits, you need to push them to GitHub for the live site to update.

1. In VS Code, click the **Source Control** icon in the left sidebar (it looks like a branching diagram)
2. You will see a list of files you have changed
3. Hover over **Changes** and click the **+** icon to stage all changes
4. In the **Message** box at the top, type a short description of what you changed (e.g. `Update team bio`)
5. Click the **Commit** button (the tick/checkmark)
6. Click the **Sync Changes** button that appears (it has arrows) — this pushes to GitHub
7. The live site will update within **1–2 minutes**

## How to Update the News Section

The News & Announcements page lives in `announcements.html`.
Each announcement is a single `<div class="announcement_card">` block inside the `<div class="announcements_grid">` container.

### Step-by-step: Adding a New Announcement

1. Open `announcements.html` in a text editor.

2. Find the `<div class="announcements_grid">` section (search for `announcements_grid`).

3. Copy an existing card block. A card looks like this:

```html
<div class="announcement_card" data-category="news">
    <div class="announcement_tag tag_news">News</div>
    <div class="announcement_date">January 2026</div>
    <h3 class="announcement_title">Your Headline Here</h3>
    <p class="announcement_desc">
        A short description of the announcement goes here. Keep it to 1–3 sentences.
    </p>
</div>
```

4. Paste the copied block **above** any existing cards (newest first).

5. Update the following fields:

| Field | What to change |
|---|---|
| `data-category="..."` | Category keyword — see table below |
| `class="announcement_tag tag_..."` | Matching tag class — see table below |
| Tag text (e.g. `News`) | Display label shown on the card |
| `announcement_date` | Month and year, e.g. `June 2025` |
| `announcement_title` | Headline text |
| `announcement_desc` | 1–3 sentence description |

### Category Reference

| Category | `data-category` value | Tag class | Tag colour |
|---|---|---|---|
| General news | `news` | `tag_news` | Blue |
| New publication | `paper` | `tag_paper` | Green |
| Grant awarded | `grant` | `tag_grant` | Purple |
| Award / prize | `award` | `tag_award` | Gold |
| Event / conference | `event` | `tag_event` | Orange |

### Example: Adding a New Paper Announcement

```html
<div class="announcement_card" data-category="paper">
    <div class="announcement_tag tag_paper">New Paper</div>
    <div class="announcement_date">May 2026</div>
    <h3 class="announcement_title">New study published in PLOS Pathogens</h3>
    <p class="announcement_desc">
        Our latest research on flavivirus NS1 protein was published in PLOS Pathogens.
        Read the full article on the Publications page.
    </p>
</div>
```

6. Save the file.

7. Push to GitHub (see Deployment below) — the live site updates automatically.

### Editing or Removing an Announcement

- **Edit** — find the card by its title and update the relevant fields.
- **Remove** — delete the entire `<div class="announcement_card"> … </div>` block.

## How to Update Team Members

### Adding a Current Team Member

Edit `team.html` and add a new flip card inside the appropriate `team_grid` section:

```html
<div class="team_card_wrapper">
    <div class="team_card">
        <div class="team_card_front">
            <img src="Images/photo.jpg" alt="Full Name" class="team_photo">
            <h3 class="team_name">Full Name</h3>
            <p class="team_role">Role Title</p>
        </div>
        <div class="team_card_back">
            <p class="team_bio">Short bio text here.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

Place the member photo (square crop recommended, JPG/PNG) in the `Images/` folder.
If no photo is available, use `Images/Placeholder.png`.

### Adding an Alumni Member

Edit the alumni grid in `team.html` and add a card inside `<div id="alumniGrid">`:

```html
<div class="alumni_card">
    <img src="Images/photo.jpg" alt="Alumni Name" class="alumni_photo">
    <h3 class="alumni_name">Alumni Name</h3>
    <p class="alumni_years">2022–2024 (PhD Student)</p>
    <ul class="alumni_role"><li>Current Position, Institution</li></ul>
</div>
```

If no photo is available, use `src="Images/Placeholder.png"`.

## Publication Management

### Adding Publications

1. Edit `references.bib` with the new BibTeX entry:

```bibtex
@article{AuthorYear,
  title   = {Article Title},
  author  = {Author Name},
  journal = {Journal Name},
  year    = {2025},
  volume  = {10},
  pages   = {1--15},
  doi     = {10.xxxx/xxxxx}
}
```

2. Run the converter:

```bash
python convert.py
```

3. This updates `references.json` — publications appear automatically on the Publications page and in the Featured Publications section on the homepage.

---

## Deployment

The site is hosted on **GitHub Pages** from the `main` branch of the `peterslab-uq/Lab-Website` repository.

### Pushing changes

```bash
cd "/path/to/Lab Website"
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Pages rebuilds the site within ~1 minute of each push.
